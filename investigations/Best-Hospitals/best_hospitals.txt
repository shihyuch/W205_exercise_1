We combine tables from readmissions and effective_care by union them through PROVIDER_ID, HOSPITAL_NAME, STATE, MEASURE_ID, MEASURE_NAME, #SCORE. Since each table has different procedures to measure. Based on the meanning of these score, we expect they are lower as better, e.g., death rate, time (delay). We use three different tables to compare hospitals. Their final results are quite different when different tables are analyzed. Except DOCTORS HOSPITAL OF WEST COVINA, it ranks before 10 at combined and Readmissions tables.
